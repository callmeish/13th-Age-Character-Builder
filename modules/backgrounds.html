      <h1>Backgrounds &amp; Skill Checks</h1>
      <p class="initial">Backgrounds represent pieces of your character’s history that contributes to your character’s history as well as their ability to succeed with non-combat skills.</p>
      <p>Each character has a number of points to allocate to a set of backgrounds. These are broad categories of experience (cat burglar, for example) rather than specific implementations of that experience (climbing and hiding).</p>
      <p>Backgrounds don’t sync to a specific ability score, though some backgrounds obviously may get used more often with certain ability scores than others.</p>
      
      <h3>Assigning Background Points</h3>
      <p>Each character gets 8 background points, plus any extra that your class’s talents award. Assign your background points to as many backgrounds as you want, up to your total points. You can assign a maximum of 5 points to a single background (and minimum of 1).</p>

      <h3>Making Skill Checks</h3>
      <p>When you roll a skill check to find out if you succeed at a task or trick, the GM tells you which ability score is being tested. Then you choose the background you think is relevant to gain the points you have in that background as a bonus to the skill check.</p>
      <p>Most skill checks require you to equal or beat a Difficulty Class (DC), set by the environment you are operating in, to succeed.</p>
      <p>To make a skill check, use this formula:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">d20 + relevant ability modifier + level + relevant background points vs. DC set by the environment</p>
      <p>You can’t apply multiple backgrounds to the same check; the background with the highest (or tied for highest) bonus applies.</p>

      <h3>Choosing Your Backgrounds</h3>
      <p>Choose backgrounds that help you make sense of your characters past, jobs, and settings. Background and skill use is meant to be about fun in-character methods of attempting to advance the plot.</p>
      <p>A few possible backgrounds for any class include: acrobat, alchemist, animal trainer, architect, aristocratic noble, assassin, chef, con-woman, goblin exterminator, hunted outlaw, knight errant, magecraft, priest, refugee, scout, shepherd, soldier, spy, temple acolyte, thief, torturer, transformed animal, traveling martial arts pupil, tribal healer, tunnel scout, wandering minstrel, and warrior poet.</p>
