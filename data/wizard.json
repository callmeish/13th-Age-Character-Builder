  "writeup": "Wizards are the masters of arcane energy. They use geometry, symbology, occult numerology, and a complex grammatical system to describe magic and thereby control it. They fill their heavy, locked spellbooks with crabbed writing, secret codes, and convoluted designs. Many “book-wizards” are more-or-less cowards who would rather study reality than experience it. The wizards that go adventuring are the rare sort who respond to mortal danger with greater focus rather than panic.",
  "backgrounds": "magical prodigy, spell thief, hedge wizard, transformed familiar, ship’s wizard, and royal poisoner.",
