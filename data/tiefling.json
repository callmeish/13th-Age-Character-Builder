  "racePowerDesc": "Once per battle as a free action when a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1â€“5 on an attack or a save, turn their roll into a natural 1 and improvise a further curse that shows how their attempt backfires horribly. A curse should have about the same impact as a typical once-per-battle ability. The GM may reward storytelling flair and/or limit the suggested effects of the curse."
